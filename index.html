            <h2>YouTube Channel Distribution</h2>
            <p>
              The symbol map on the right represents the distribution of
              approximately <strong>1000 YouTube Channels</strong> up until
              <strong>2022</strong>. Notably, <strong>America</strong> is the
              only country that exceed the 50-300 range, with over
              <strong>30%</strong> of the total channels. Follow closely by
              <strong>India</strong> and <strong>Brazil</strong>, each boast
              <strong>168</strong> and <strong>62</strong> YouTube channels,
              respectively. <br /><br />
              In contrast,
              <strong>Australia</strong> houses only <strong>9</strong> out of
              these 1000 channels. However, since channel ranking is based on
              subscriber counts, it's imperative that we delve deeper into this
              aspect to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the
              ecosystem.

            <h2>Average Subscribers per Channel</h2>
            <p>
              It comes to no suprise that <strong>America</strong> leads in
              total subscribers, given its significant number of channels. To
              ensure a fair analysis, we shift our focus to the average number
              of subscribers per channel. <br /><br />
              Using this approach, countries with fewer YouTube channels tend to
              exhibit higher average subscriber counts. For instance, countries
              like <strong>Cuba</strong> and <strong>Venezuela</strong>, each
              represented by only 1 channel within the top 1000, boast
              remarkably high average subscribers per channel.

            <p>
              Fun fact: If everyone in <strong>America</strong> has a YouTube
              channel, then each person will have
              <strong>22</strong> subscribers. This is the highest among all the
              other countries, indicating a significant level of engagement with
              the platform. Followed by
              <strong>United Arab Emirates</strong> and
              <strong>United Kingdom</strong> of <strong>15</strong> and
              <strong>14</strong> subscribers per capita respectively.

            <p>
              Having explored the global data on channels and subscribers for
              each country, our next step is to examine their distribution
              across various categories. Our focus will be on
              <strong>America</strong> and <strong>India</strong>, as they have
              a significant number of channels and subscribers globally.
              Additionally, we will include <strong>Australia</strong> in our
              analysis.

          <h2>Balance Distribution in America</h2>
          <p>
            The distribution of channels vs. subscribers in each category
            appears relatively balanced with no significant differences.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Entertainment</strong> and <strong>Music</strong> stand out
            for their notably higher engagement compared to other categories. In
            contrast, <strong>Education</strong> is one of the few categories
            where the percentage of subscribers outweighs the number of channels
            created within that category, which is a good sign and suggest that
            more channels of this category should be created.

          <h2>Unbalance Distribution in India</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Entertainment</strong> and <strong>Music</strong> is once
            again the most prominent categories. However, there are more notable
            disparities between channels and subscribers. For instance, there is
            a highter percentage of channels producing content in
            <strong>Entertainment</strong> compared to the subscriber
            percentage. <br /><br />
            On the otherhand, data in the <strong>Music</strong> category
            suggest that there are a smaller number of channels, but each
            channel tends to have a significantly higher number of subscribers

            Among the 9 channels from Australia that are part of the top 1000,
            none belong to the <strong>Entertainment</strong> category, which
            has shown substantial popularity elsewhere. <br /><br />
            The distribution between channels and subscribers appears relatively
            balanced, with
            <strong>Gaming</strong> emerging as the most popular category.

              The scatter plot depicts the evolution of the YouTube industry
              from <strong>2005</strong> to <strong>2022</strong>, showcasing
              the growth of YouTubers and content creators over the years. The
              x-axis represents the year the channel created, the y-axis and
              point sizes indicate the current number of subscribers and the
              overall views the channels have accumulated until 2022. The graph
              can be customized by adjusting the sliders below to alter the year
              and the number of channels displayed.

            <strong>T-series</strong>, a music channel based in
            <strong>India</strong>, being the most subscribed channel in the

            Furthermore, as we extend the sliders to reveal more channels, more 
            categories start to emerge,
            with the <strong>Entertainment</strong>> category appearing to be the most prominent
            among them.
